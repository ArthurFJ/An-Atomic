- Directory: `/exercises/`
- Solutions: `/solutions/` (or branch `solutions`)

## Challenges

#### **Challenge 0: Basic Python Skills**
**Name:** Interdimensional Chess
**Concepts:**
- Variables, data types, lists/dictionaries
- I/O
- Loops, conditionals, basic functions

**Task:**
Create a chess game with some extra rules that:
- Takes inputs from the user for moves.
- Validates moves based on chess rules.
- Players can move pieces in a 3D space.
- Validates moves based on chess rules.
- Keeps track of the game state (e.g., check, checkmate).
- *(Bonus)* Add a simple AI opponent that makes random moves.

**Goal:** Reinforce basic Python skills and game logic.

#### **Challenge 1: Basic Python**
**Name:** Personal Budget Tracker  
**Concepts:**
- Variables, data types, lists/dictionaries
- I/O (file handling for saving data)
- Loops, conditionals, basic functions  

**Task:**  
Build a CLI program that:  
- Asks users to input income and expenses (categories: food, rent, etc.).  
- Stores transactions in a dictionary/list and saves to a file.  
- Calculates monthly savings/discrepancies.  
- *(Bonus)* Plot expenses using `matplotlib`.  

**Goal:** Reinforce basics and file handling.

---

#### **Challenge 2: OOP + Modules**
**Name:** Library Management System  
**Concepts:**
- Classes (Book, Library, User)  
- Inheritance (e.g., Admin vs. Member users)  
- File I/O (save/load library data)  
- Exception handling (e.g., duplicate books)  

**Task:**  
- Create classes for books, users, and library operations (checkout, return).  
- Use JSON files to persist data.  
- Add search functionality (by title/author).  
- *(Bonus)* Use `datetime` to track due dates.  

**Goal:** Master OOP and modular design.

---

#### **Challenge 3: Functional Programming + APIs**
**Name:** Weather CLI Tool  
**Concepts:**
- API requests (`requests` module)  
- JSON parsing  
- Functional tools (`map`, `filter` to process data)  
- Decorators (e.g., cache API responses)  

**Task:**  
- Fetch weather data from a free API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).  
- Display forecasts based on user input (city).  
- Use `filter` to show only rainy days or `map` to convert units.  
- *(Bonus)* Add plotting for temperature trends.  

**Goal:** Combine functional programming with real-world data.

---

#### **Challenge 4: Advanced Data + Concurrency**
**Name:** Multithreaded Web Scraper  
**Concepts:**
- Web scraping (`BeautifulSoup`, `requests`)  
- Threading (scrape multiple pages concurrently)  
- Error handling (404, rate limits)  
- Advanced data structures (e.g., queue for URLs)  

**Task:**  
- Scrape a website (e.g., news headlines or product prices).  
- Use threading to speed up fetching.  
- Save results to CSV.  
- *(Bonus)* Compare threaded vs. sequential performance.  

**Goal:** Introduce concurrency and large-scale data handling.

---

#### **Challenge 5: Full-Stack Mini-App**
**Name:** Flask Todo App with Auth  
**Concepts:**
- Flask (routes, templates)  
- Databases (SQLite + `sqlalchemy`)  
- Bytes/serialization (user uploads)  
- Regex (input validation)  

**Task:**  
- Build a Todo app with user authentication.  
- Allow file uploads (e.g., task attachments).  
- Deploy to Heroku/Replit.  
- *(Bonus)* Add email reminders (`smtplib`).
